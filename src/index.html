    <h1>Comments-B-Gone</h1>

    <p>
        Facebook recently introduced a feature to show comments on your news feed, even for pages' posts. And, if you're
        like me, you follow a lot of news pages and get a lot of name-calling.
    </p>

    <p>
        This bookmarklet will hide and show comments on Facebook by using their own styles. As of this version, you'll still see some of the structure around them, but the comments themselves will be hidden. Enjoy!
    </p>

    <div class="panel panel-primary">
        <div class="panel-heading">
            <h2 class="panel-title">Installation</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>
                To install, drag this link to your bookmarks bar. Click the bookmark to hide or show Facebook comments.
