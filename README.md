This hasn't been updated in nine years, and definitely doesn't work anymore.

# comments-b-gone
Facebook recently introduced a feature to show comments on your news feed, even for pages' posts. And, if you're like me, you follow a lot of news pages and get a lot of name-calling.

This bookmarklet will hide and show comments on Facebook by using their own styles. As of this version, you'll still see some of the structure around them, but the comments themselves will be hidden.

## Installation
Installation is easy. Head to [the project page](http://tdukart.github.io/comments-b-gone) for full instructions.

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal style guide, please try to match the existing style as much as possible (for what little code there actually is).

To build, run `grunt` to generate the HTML file in the `dist` directory.
